# Switch

Decentralized network for creators and builders with JSON resume on IPFS and smart contract for referral tokenomics

## Description

- **traditional **professional networks are not user-friendly for engineers. we want to control the data, see real connections, and avoid useless spam.
- on Sw/.tch, users create and host their profiles in the form of a standardized **JSON on IPFS**. benefit: data control, anyone can scrape and search using their own tools without the limitation of traditional UI
- when 2 users worked together or know each other well, they can **stake **FIL (or other payment tokens) into their connection. think of it as a twitter blue mark but for connections instead of profiles
- if one user wants an **introduction **to a friend of a friend in the network, they pay a fee.
- stakes in connections have voting rights in a **DAO ** that decide on fees, investment strategy, and rewards
- FEVM **marketplace **controls the hosting of the profile data on IPFS
