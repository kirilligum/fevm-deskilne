Decentralized network for creators and builders with JSON resume on IPFS and smart contract for referral tokenomics

- **traditional **professional networks are not user-friendly for engineers. we want to control the data, see real connections and less messaging noisy.
- people create and host their profiles in the form of a standardized **JSON on IPFS**. benefit: data control, anyone can build an easily searchable database (scrape and fill Postgress, for example), where a recruiter has full flexibility of creating queries forgoing the limitations of custodial professional networks
- when 2 users worked together or know each other well, they can **stake **FIL (or other payment tokens) into their connection. think of it as a twitter blue mark but for connections instead of profiles
- **referral fee** if one user wants an introduction to a friend of a friend in the network, they pay a fee.
